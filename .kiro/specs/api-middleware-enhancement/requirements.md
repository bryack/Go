# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing to-do list API with comprehensive middleware functionality to improve security, monitoring, error handling, and request processing. The current implementation has basic logging middleware, but lacks essential production-ready middleware components such as CORS support, rate limiting, request validation, and structured error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper CORS headers to be set so that I can access the API from web browsers without cross-origin restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is made THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, and Access-Control-Allow-Headers
2. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL include CORS headers in the response
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL support configurable allowed origins, methods, and headers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want rate limiting middleware so that I can protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage across clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client exceeds the configured request rate THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
2. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL include rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) in responses
3. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL support per-IP rate limiting with configurable limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced request logging middleware so that I can monitor API usage and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any request is processed THEN the system SHALL log request method, path, status code, response time, and client IP
2. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL support structured logging with configurable log levels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error response format so that I can handle errors predictably in my client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a standardized error response with error code, message, and timestamp
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return detailed field-level error information
3. WHEN internal errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages without exposing internal details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want request timeout middleware so that long-running requests don't consume server resources indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request exceeds the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 408 Request Timeout
2. WHEN timeout middleware is active THEN the system SHALL support configurable timeout durations
3. WHEN a request times out THEN the system SHALL log the timeout event for monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want request size limiting middleware so that I can prevent large payloads from overwhelming the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request body exceeds the configured size limit THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 413 Payload Too Large
2. WHEN request size limiting is active THEN the system SHALL support configurable maximum request body sizes
3. WHEN oversized requests are rejected THEN the system SHALL log the rejection for security monitoring
