# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the current JSON file-based storage system with a robust SQLite database implementation. The integration will maintain the existing Storage interface while providing better data persistence, concurrent access handling, and query capabilities. This enhancement will make the task management system more scalable and production-ready while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace JSON file storage with SQLite database storage, so that the application can handle concurrent access more reliably and provide better data persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the SQLite database file if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the required database schema (tasks table) if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN multiple instances access the database concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without data corruption
4. WHEN the existing Storage interface is used THEN the system SHALL work identically to the current JSON implementation
5. IF the database file is corrupted or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database connection management, so that the application efficiently uses database resources and handles connection failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a database connection pool with appropriate limits
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically handle connection acquisition and release
3. WHEN a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly close all database connections
5. WHEN connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and handle them when connections become available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database schema management and migrations, so that the database structure can evolve safely over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check the current database schema version
2. WHEN schema migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically apply them in the correct order
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and report the error clearly
4. WHEN the database is empty THEN the system SHALL create the initial schema with proper indexes and constraints
5. IF future schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support adding new migrations without breaking existing data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for database operations, so that the application provides clear feedback when database issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return specific error types that can be handled appropriately
2. WHEN SQL constraint violations occur THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN database is locked or busy THEN the system SHALL retry operations with appropriate timeouts
4. WHEN database disk space is full THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN database operations succeed THEN the system SHALL return the expected data without errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database implementation to support all existing task operations, so that no functionality is lost during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LoadTasks() is called THEN the system SHALL return all tasks from the database in the same format as JSON storage
2. WHEN SaveTasks() is called THEN the system SHALL persist all tasks to the database and replace existing data
3. WHEN individual task operations are performed THEN the system SHALL support direct database queries for better performance
4. WHEN task data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain the same Task struct format and JSON serialization
5. WHEN the database contains existing data THEN the system SHALL preserve task IDs and maintain data consistency
